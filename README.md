This is a simple example of making an HTTP request, inspecting the response, and handling the data returned by a web server.

The code connects to a url like www.example.com over HTTP, sends a GET request to the root URL (/), retrieves the response, and prints the type, status code, and reason of the response.

If the status code indicates success (200 OK), it reads the response content (the HTML or data) and prints it.
